# Travel Serenity (Front-end)
MERN Stack Hotel Booking Website

## Description:
Travel Serenity is a comprehensive web application that allows users to search, select, and book hotel rooms. The platform includes user authentication, search functionality by location, date range, number of adults, children, and rooms, and a secure payment system (disclaimer: payment system does not actually work for security reasons). Users can create accounts, log in, and manage their bookings. The application is built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and uses JWT and cookies for secure authentication. State management is handled by the Context API, ensuring a seamless and efficient user experience.
